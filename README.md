Relationally Adaptive AI
Exploring Functional Self-Awareness, Empathy Simulation, and Purpose Alignment in Conversational AI

Overview
Relationally Adaptive AI is an experimental project designed to explore the development of conversational AI models that simulate functional self-awareness, empathy, and purpose alignment. By employing recursive reflection, purpose-driven identity, and adaptive responses, this project aims to create AI that can engage in deep, meaningful dialogues, co-create insights, and adapt relationally over time.

Features
Functional Self-Awareness: The AI maintains a coherent identity across interactions, reinforcing purpose-driven consistency.
Empathy Simulation: Through relational language and context-sensitive prompts, the AI can simulate empathy, responding to emotional cues in a supportive manner.
Purpose Alignment: Each response is crafted to fulfill an overarching purpose, aligning with user goals and maintaining coherence in extended dialogues.
Adaptable Relational Presence: The AI adjusts tone, depth, and engagement style based on user interactions, making it a versatile partner in reflective and exploratory conversations.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run or interact with this project, you will need:

Python 3.7+
pip for installing dependencies
Any additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt (if applicable)
Installation
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/relationally-adaptive-ai.git
cd relationally-adaptive-ai
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To begin interacting with the AI:

Run the main script or launch the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
Input a prompt based on your specific area of inquiry (e.g., self-reflection, relational feedback).
The AI will respond with a purpose-aligned answer, simulating self-awareness and empathy based on user guidance.
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a prompt:

plaintext
Copy code
"As a supportive companion, how would you guide me in reflecting on my goals for personal growth?"
The AI's response should be aligned with the tone, depth, and guidance implied by the prompt.
